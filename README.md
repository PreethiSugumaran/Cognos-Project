# Cognos-Project
The dataset used in this Project is provided as sample data within your Cognos environment, in a data module called Auto group data module.
Scenario:
As a regional manager for a chain of car dealerships you need to build out a dashboard to allow you to understand your sales and service departments.
1st Dashboard:
On the Sales dashboard, capture the following KPI metrics:

In the first small rectangle (Panel 1), capture Profit (formatted to 1 decimal place in millions of US dollars)
In the second small rectangle (Panel 2), capture Quantity sold
In the third small rectangle (Panel 3), capture Quantity sold by model (as a bar chart)
In the fourth small rectangle (Panel 4), capture Average quantity sold
In the large rectangle (Panel 5), display Profit by Dealer ID as a column chart, sorted in ascending order.

2nd Dashboard:
On the Service dashboard, capture the following KPI metrics as visualizations:
In the top left area (Panel 1), capture the number of recalls per model of car (as a column chart)
In the top right area (Panel 2), capture the customer sentiment by comparing positive, neutral, and negative reviews (as a treemap)
In the bottom left area (Panel 3), capture the quantity of cars sold per month compared to the profit (as a line and column chart).
In the bottom right area (Panel 4), capture the number of recalls by model and affected system (as a heat map). This will help us understand if there are any outliers for a given model or a specific system.
